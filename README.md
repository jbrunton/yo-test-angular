Trying out Yeoman, Grunt and Bower with a Foundation app

## Creating the app

I based the setup off of [this article](http://shoogledesigns.com/blog/blog/2013/08/02/speed-up-your-css-framework-install-with-yeoman/) by Flo Preynat.  It's a little manual, but works.  The steps were:

1. Run the ```yo webapp``` generator.
2. Remove the sass-bootstrap dependency with ```bower uninstall --save sass-bootstrap```.
3. Remove the references to sass-bootsrap from the ```main.scss``` file generated by Yeoman.

You can see the initial changes to the generated yeoman project in this commit: [5c8071e](https://github.com/jbrunton/yo-test-foundation/commit/5c8071ed21dcefc2bf7e91810062688b80a12686).

## Deployment

The app is hosted with Github Pages at [jbrunton.github.io/yo-test-foundation/](http://jbrunton.github.io/yo-test-foundation/).

Deployment is handled using ```deploy.sh``` from [git-directory-deploy](https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy) (wrapped in the ```grunt deploy``` command).
