==================

Trying out Yeoman, Grunt and Bower with a Foundation app

## Try it out

First, clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:jbrunton/yo-test-foundation.git && cd yo-test-foundation
    
Make sure you have NPM installed.  If you don't, ```nvm``` is a handy script to use.  You can install it from [nvm on GitHub](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

You'll also want to have ```grunt-cli``` and ```bower``` installed:

    npm install -g bower grunt-cli
    
Finally, install the dependencies for the app:

    npm install
    bower install

## Creating the app

I based the setup off of [this article](http://shoogledesigns.com/blog/blog/2013/08/02/speed-up-your-css-framework-install-with-yeoman/) by Flo Preynat.  It's a little manual, but works.  The steps were:

1. Run the ```yo webapp``` generator.
2. Remove the sass-bootstrap dependency with ```bower uninstall --save sass-bootstrap```.
3. Remove the references to sass-bootsrap from the ```main.scss``` file generated by Yeoman.

You can see the initial changes to the generated yeoman project in this commit: [5c8071e](https://github.com/jbrunton/yo-test-foundation/commit/5c8071ed21dcefc2bf7e91810062688b80a12686).

## Deployment

The app is hosted with Github Pages at [jbrunton.github.io/yo-test-foundation/](http://jbrunton.github.io/yo-test-foundation/).

Deployment is handled using ```deploy.sh``` from [git-directory-deploy](https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy) (wrapped in the ```grunt deploy``` command).

## Testing

### Running the tests

Simple: ```grunt test```.

### Configuration

This app replaces the default webapp choice of Mocha as a testing framework with Karma and Jasmine.  The steps to do this were:

1. Uninstall mocha with ```npm uninstall --save-dev mocha```
2. Install Karma with ```npm install --save-dev karma && npm install --save-dev grunt-karma```
3. Create the Karma config file: ```./node_modules/.bin/karma init```

Finally, I made a few changes to the Gruntfile in this commit: [900545d](https://github.com/jbrunton/yo-test-foundation/commit/900545d22ed0ac3cd816a32fa2c78b57aab1cdde).

### CI

The app also has a [.travis.yml](https://github.com/jbrunton/yo-test-foundation/blob/master/.travis.yml) file to enable continuous integration with Travis.

By default, Travis runs ```npm test``` for projects using NPM.  I therefore added a test script to the package.json file: [acaca69](https://github.com/jbrunton/yo-test-foundation/commit/acaca6996af0cd61446c4c77640c58f10b13d169)
